# Computational Physics Questions (CompPhyQ)
A set of problem set questions for sophomore through senior level 
undergraduate physics courses arranged by topic. These problems are meant
to be assigned in addition to the standard paper & pen analytical questions.
Topics covered will be contained in courses such as:

	- Modern Physics
	- Classical Mechanics
	- Electrodynamics
	- Experimental Physics
	- Quantum Mechanics
	- Optics
	- Statistical Mechanics
	- Astrophysics
	
For reasons I do not understand, Github doesn't render the images I added to my notebooks, so if you want
to see a better preview, I recommend looking at them at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/paulnakroshis/ComputationalPhysicsQuestions/tree/main/) .
